# TUI-code-judging
A TUI implementation of online code judging for Python code, using curses.

### About requirements:
If you're on a windows machine, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.


### About safety:
This code is 100% certified to be very very unsafe for your machine. If you're planning on hosting this, **MAKE SURE YOUR USERS ARE TRUSTED**. The exec() function runs on the server side, and I'd hate to see your 1TB porn folder leaked for all your friends to see.
